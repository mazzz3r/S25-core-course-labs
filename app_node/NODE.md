# Node.js Web Application Documentation

## Framework Choice: Express

Express was selected for this web application due to its minimalistic and unopinionated nature, allowing for flexible and efficient development of server-side applications. Its vast ecosystem of middleware and robust routing capabilities make it ideal for creating scalable web applications.

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Project Initialization:**
   - Utilized `npm` for package management and initialized the project with `package.json` for dependency tracking.

2. **Templating Engine:**
   - Employed EJS as the templating engine to render dynamic content seamlessly.

3. **Code Organization:**
   - Structured the application with separate folders for views to maintain clarity and organization.

4. **Modular Code:**
   - Kept the code modular by separating route handling and server setup.

## Coding Standards

- **Consistent Indentation:**
  - Used 2 spaces for indentation to maintain code consistency.
  
- **Descriptive Variable Names:**
  - Employed clear and descriptive names for variables and functions to enhance readability.

- **Commenting:**
  - Added comments to explain code segments for better understanding.

## Testing

- **Manual Testing:**
  - Verified that a new motivational quote is displayed upon each page refresh.
  - Ensured server stability and proper rendering of views.

## Code Quality

- **Readability:**
  - Maintained high code readability through proper formatting and logical structuring.

- **Scalability:**
  - Designed the application with scalability in mind, allowing for easy addition of new features or routes.
